<h1>The Best Movies According to Wooje</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Old Boy</h3>
<p>Made me think about what's the point of living. If we aren't free to effect changes, aren't we all living in a jail that we or others have created?</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Made me question societal norm. Why should we be pressured by others to doing things? Let the dice fall where they may.</p>

<h3>Love Me if You Dare</h3>
<p>If there is someone you love, you should hold on to them.</p>
